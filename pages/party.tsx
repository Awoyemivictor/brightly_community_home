          <p className="mb">
            I wake up really early and in an ideal world, I’ll always get to the
            gym first thing, so I actually block my calendar in the mornings for
            that. I always block it off and won’t schedule things for that time
            unless there’s something important other people are asking of me. If
            I need to, I'll take that important morning meeting. But otherwise,
            I normally block off the first couple of hours in my morning to head
            to the gym.
          </p>
          <p className="small">
            Typically, if I'm taking care of myself physically, I just feel a
            lot more energized to tackle the rest of the day. I’ll go to the
            gym, have a cup of coffee and then feel ready to work through the
            rest of the day.

          <p className="small mb">
            I definitely spend too much time on Twitter. It probably is still
            kind of my favorite tool for staying on top of things. And then
            there are a couple of resources that I subscribe to.
          </p>
          <p className="small">
            I’ll check out the daily Ralpha newsletter, Zen Academy’s
            newsletter. But I would say that, for the most part, Twitter
            normally has people posting a lot

          <h3>On staying well while web3-ing</h3>
          <p className="small">
            It's definitely hard- I think there's a general expectation to stay
            on top of it. Like it just feels like a space never sleeps, and
            that’s very challenging.

            Weekends are critical. They’re when I try and take things a little
            easier, and I’m on Twitter much less on the weekends. You kind of
            have to be gracious of yourself- you're always going to miss out on
            things like no matter how hard you try and that's okay. It's going
            to be impossible to stay on top of everything.

          <h3>On curating a positive space for yourself online</h3>
          <p className="small mb">
            I think it’s so important to look at who’s making it onto your feed.
            Who do you want to surround yourself with? I see very little
            negativity on my feeds (not zero, because never say never). Based on
            what I’ve curated, I see really uplifting and beautiful art. I love
            following and supporting a lot of creators. For the most part I feel
            like I’ve created a really friendly, nice spot here on Twitter.

          <p className="small">
            But yeah, like I think it's almost my I think I feel like my regular
            day is so full of me, like using my brain. So I love watching shows
            that doesn't that don't work. And so yeah, I get a real kick out of
            doing that and I love watching sports as well. I suppose it's like I
            met a great way for me to like just kind of tune out and just, you
            know. Yeah. So that, that, that's generally what I. But I love, I
            love it.

            We're always listening. I don't think that we're going to follow it
            to the tee, but I think we definitely always have a lookout for
            that, positive or negative- it’s something that we always pay
            attention to.
          </p>
          <p className="small">
            It's definitely challenging. Obviously, being switched on at all
            times is not sustainable, but at the same time, there is value from
            always just knowing what's going on on a high level. And so I do
            find it a really useful and valuable signal, but at the same time,
            it’s critical to still stay true to your company’s long-term vision
            and direction. Things may not always go according to plan at any
            time, but knowing what that Northstar is for you is something that's
            really, really useful.

          Don’t get stressed about not understanding what an NFT is or how it
          works. NFTs are unique digital goods. This is all the definition that
          you need. It’s just unique identifier for a thing that lives online.
        </p>
        <p className="rb">
          Yes, NFTs can be '“expensive jps” but they’re also membership cards
          and fundraising vehicles and representations of real estate and so, so
          much more. 🎀{" "}

            Ps: DAOs are also an awesome type of community to join!
          </span>{" "}
          A DAO is a member-owned community that operates without a centralized
          leader, coordinating and operating through a shared set of rules
          enforced on a blockchain.{" "}
          <span className="it">
            You can think of them as an internet-native business that’s
            collectively owned and managed by its members.
          </span>
          DAOs and their members usually form around a shared mission, interest,
          or goal.
        </p>
        <div className="separator" />
        <p className="bottom_text">
          Unlike traditional organizations and corporations, DAOs are
          decentralized- operating primarily through the internet and unifying
          members from all over the world. Also unlike traditional hierarchical
          organizations, DAOs emphasize democratization. In a traditional org, a
          small, centralized authority is typically driving most of the
          decision-making process. In a DAO, decisions and ideas are voted upon
          by the entire community, ensuring every member has a voice in the
          current and future direction of the organization. Members are also
          free to submit their own ideas.
          <br />
          <br />
          Another thing all DAOs have in common is that they all have a
          Treasury- a pool of money collectively owned and managed by the DAO’s
          members. Within a DAO, members can make proposals to vote upon how
          this money is used.✨💅💫
